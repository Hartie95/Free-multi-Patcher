Free multi Patcher
==================================

This application for the 3DS allows to patch systemmodules while using system or emunand and with and without using firmlaunch. Because of this it allows E-Shop access on all 9.x firmware verions and regionfree in Pasta and other CFWs.
It also allows other peoples to create, add and share own patches using the patchlayout defined by this [wiki page](https://github.com/hartmannaf/Free-multi-Patcher/wiki/patchlayout)
